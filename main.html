                     the second issue of the FKS Tribune magazine! I hope you all 
                     are excited to divulge this issue’s topic: Human Relations. 
                     (Trust me it’s not as boring as it sounds). The Topic of Human
                      Relations regards the way humans have interacted for centuries
                       as well as the modern age of 2021. Thoughts, opinions and 
                       criticisms are all man-made notions, relating to Human 
                       Relations and fundamental to our daily life, be it professionally,
                        socially or personally.<br><span id="aaa" >...</span><span id="sss" style="display: none;">

                <p>The year 2020 started off like any other year. Everyone was looking forward to the new academic
                     year, new friends, new resolutions, goals and aspirations. 
                    2020 surprisingly had something <strong>unexpected</strong> planned for all of us.
                </p>
                    
                    <p>FKS was off to a great start at the beginning of the year. All the students were involved
                         in different activities and courses of the <strong>inter house competition</strong> between the Whiz and the Super house.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>In India, during the first week of February the COVID19 cases were gradually increasing.
                         The schools started shutting down, and by the second week of March <strong>‘Lockdown’</strong> was called 
                         by the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi. A preventive measure to contain the spread of COVID-19.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>As the lockdown was during March it was not far from the summer vacation which is usually 
                        in the first week of April. So most of the schools have announced summer break for all the
                         grades one to eight. Mercifully, the time favored where all the grades had finished their final term assessments.

                  <p>There were some immediate measures to shift the education. The education system scrambled to find alternative options to resume schooling.
                       Our school introduced online classes on ‘Vedamo’ for grades nine and above to <strong>experiment</strong> the new way of learning. </p>

                    <p>Students, teachers, parents and everyone were curious to analyze the challenges and benefits of revolutionary change in schooling.  
                    Stable high speed internet access suddenly gained importance in the midst of this pandemic. 
                    Many teachers were not equipped with appropriate devices for delivering smooth classes.</p> 
                    
                    <p>Most of the students and teachers got all their internet/WI-FI cables fixed and use of technical knowledge was needed. The priority moved to learn software's tools like 
                    zoom 
                    PowerPoint presentation</p>
                    
                    <p>The drastic transition to an <strong>‘online class room’</strong> was not easy to adapt for students also.
                    Children were missing the energetic atmosphere of the classroom. The shouting, mingling, teasing and running around was being missed out and was restricted only to an online chat. This was affecting the children's physical and mental growth. </p>
                    
                    <p>White board markers to a white screen and writing pages to typing keys.</p>
                    
                    <p>Online platform ‘Vedamo’ was replaced by ‘CodeTantra’ which is still being used for classes. Additionally we have zoom rooms for each grade.
                    CodeTantra was being used for all the academics while Zoom was being used for assembly, group activities and teacher’s meetings.</p>

                    Kids got opportunities to think outside the box when they let go off the negativity and aimed their efforts towards creativity.

                    Our schedules for each day had a period called <strong>‘Offline and Chatting’</strong>, 
                    The offline, where all the students get a hard copy of a worksheet sent by the school for
                     each month (when the cases were low and safe). This was provided so that we students do not 
                     strain our eyes sitting in front of our screens which gave us sufficient time to give a break from the device. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The chatting time is where all the grades have fun and interaction with our fellow peers and 
                    teachers, this interaction with the teacher and students was a mellow stress buster free time.

                    The grade nine students were an extraordinary, unique batch of students who have shown great commitment during every event and celebrations of the year.
                    It was the year which taught us how to balance our studies as well as fun, during the planning time for the events. 
                    Having a must experience to work alongside the FKS family opened our eyes to the outside world. It gave us an experience which builds the foundation for our near future. The school has always believed in giving a fair and equal opportunity to develop our character traits. 
                    We have always been and will be prepared for the ‘future’ and bring a value to our opinions and perspective.

                    <strong>Our interviews</strong> were not like any other year. Being online the seniors who conduct each stage of interviews for every student of grade nine has been an experience which has helped us look at ourselves in different angles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Personally by the time I have gone through all the rounds of the interviews with different questions and different seniors and teachers with different purpose of teaching which gives us a learning experience that life outside will treat you very hard and when you aim to go high, you should remember to stay grounded because when you fall you won’t hurt yourself hard. 
                    Keeping your eyes on the stars and the feet on the ground has helped us stay calm and Courageous. 
                </p>
                <p>    
                    By the time I have completed going through all the rounds of the cabinet interview process, I definitely have grown as an individual and built a strong foundation for myself.

                        <strong>Planning</strong> for the events was a good spirit of hard work and team work. 
                        It is when our grade comes together and pitches in different ideas for different events. 
                        Our batch 2020 - 2021 was the first batch to have our cabinet ‘online’.

                    <p>
                        We are proud to say that we are the batch of the ‘online year’ because we had a completely 
                        different approach to different problems and have valued our bond and worked as a team with
                         great sportsman spirit and have accepted all the differences, challenges and obstacles in our way. 
                        Although we were not at school we still had the spirit and excitement to work towards
                         something big. All of us in the past, as juniors have always looked forward to this 
                         ‘cabinet year’. Unfortunately we did not get to do the events at school but at the end of
                          the day we have learnt to take everyone's strengths and fight the challenges and organized
                           ourselves over the internet.

                         Our grade got very excited hearing this news! We had finished our 
                         assessment and immediately planned for our first in person school event. 
                         We were very lucky to have a chance to plan an event and get the experience 
                         to work at school and also see everyone after a very long time!
                    </p>
                    <p>The school endeavoured to send wonderful, unforgettable gifts for Christmas,
                        when the COVID 19 cases were controlled and everyone was following the safety
                        precautions. The gift was the school's tasty, yummy <i>‘Sambar and Idli’</i>. School
                        ensured that each and everyone had received the gift and had got the joy of 
                        tasting the school's food after a long time!

                        <p>All grades have gotten used to the online atmosphere and still have a feeling
                             of getting back to school. Many students have the friendly and family like 
                             bond which is attached and developed to school over the past years and call
                              it their <strong>‘Second Home’</strong>. They really missed the physical school environment 
                              and the lovely food at school.

                                <i>The FKS family</i> has made exceptional efforts to make the students feel just 
                                like they would, physically in school. The teachers have also learnt from 
                                the tech savvy kids and have made learning fun, taking the best use of what everyone has.

                                     of each student’s view and  helped us students  remotely build our character

      <p style="text-align: center;width:70%;float: center;margin-left: 13%;">Many, many thanks to all the people 
        who worked backstage to bring this magazine to life. Besides writing articles we needed people to design 
        the website and magazine, to help us get ideas for new articles, to proofread and refine them after they 
        were finished, and to inspire and encourage us to think bigger and make the Tribune the fantastic platform
         it is today. We also thank our seniors, who had the first idea for this magazine and got it started, and
          also encouraged and supported us after we took over. Special thanks to all those below, and to many more
           who inspired and assisted us quietly, even though they're not mentioned.</p>
