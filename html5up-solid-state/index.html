										<p>Menstruation is a normal process in every girl's life. Girls go through some pain and annoyances but it doesn’t affect the personal or educational development of the girls in the urban areas. But it's not the same in rural areas.

											Project Omega was a fundraiser which the 12th and 10th graders organized to help many girls in the rural areas across India. <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> It was a brilliant initiative taken by the students of FKS to create an impact in the society. They wanted to provide the girls with access to decent sanitation and hygiene essentials to ensure that they don’t drop out of school and miss their valuable education.
											
											They aimed towards giving hygienic kits, to improve bathroom conditions and counsel girls on the importance of menstrual health and hygiene. Many girls drop out of their schools and interests because of their menstrual cycle.  And our students didn’t want that to happen.
											There were widespread restrictions and negative perceptions around menstruation that contributed to strong gender disparities in health and education. It even prevented them from doing daily activities like cooking, praying, exercising or even being in their homes.
											Infact, menstruation is still a barrier to achieve gender equality.
											
											Our FKS students have taken a step forward to make an absolute impact in the society on one of the major problems in rural areas and have successfully achieved it. 
											A big thank you to all the contributors who made this happen. </p> </span>

										<p>Heal a Child Foundation is a Charitable trust & Non-Profit Organization, founded to help sick children in need of medical treatment.
											They try to help sick children, they do not focus on a specific area of illness. Treatment is available to any sickness and anyone irrespective of their religion and caste. 
											Their mission is to heal and save young children. <span id="dots1">...</span><span id="more1"> Children come to the emergency room and when the parents find out the cost of treatment, they take them away without treatment due to lack of affordability.
											They help families who cannot afford to pay the medical expenses that come with prolonged in-patient treatment at the hospital.
											They raise funds for those little ones who are in need and support. 
											Hats off to their dedication and passion to help our ones of the future generation. 
											Many individuals, families and corporates have contributed to this wonderful cause of raising funds to save these children. The children who are supported are directly referred by. The team at Heal-a-Child evaluates the financial situation of the parents & then makes a decision to support the child based on certain financial criteria.
											The foundation, which started in June 2010, has saved over 650 children in the last ten years.
											As we all believe that every drop fills the ocean. Every donation and contribution will make a change and save lives.

										<p>Hi there! We’re Ishita, Sanjana, Aryan and Aaditi from grade 12. We hope you’re having a good day and are staying safe. We recently have started a new venture 'Taabiir Blogs.' We post articles on carefully chosen topics and reviews of movies/books/TV shows, every Saturday. Our blog attempts to reveal to our readers the different opinions and perspectives around one carefully chosen topic. With our posts, we hope to educate ourselves along with our readers that the sky has got more than just clouds.

											ARE FEMININITY, BEAUTY AND MORALITY CONNECTED?

											
											Femininity. Beauty. Morality. These words that we’ve been using for so long are almost as common as the words moon, eyes and soap. These words could be powerful enough to destroy an entire civilization if used properly. What matters is that these words exist. I would like to tell you: use your words wisely. 
											
											Femininity is supposedly about the nature of a woman. I believe that no matter who someone is, they should be embraced. We’ve got so many flavors of ice creams and so many more to be invented, it wouldn’t hurt to champion them now would it? 
											
											Being able to accept something or someone is what beauty is all about. Beauty is the combination of qualities that pleases the intellect. While a few of us believe this includes certain combinations, I think it’s every combination because a desire to cut ties with the sun doesn’t exactly make it possible, does it?
											
											Morality allegedly is specifically a system of values and conduct. I don’t think there’s anything specific about that. Everyone has their own personal values and so much has changed since when the term was coined! There might be certain actions that aren’t exactly encouraged, but at the end of the day, it depends upon how you are and what you believe. I think that’s the beauty of morality. It’s entirely personal.
											
											Femininity has been believed as something that is about beauty and that beauty exists because of morality. CIt has been defined so by people who just hadn’t thought through things as much as we do and that’s okay. What is sad though is that so many of us still believe in it. It is just truly disappointing. Maybe all of these concepts are connected or maybe not. It is subjective. They certainly don’t define each other. That is for sure.
											<br><br>
											Written by Sanjana
											
											For many years now femininity, beauty and morality often come across as terms that are highly interconnected. Beauty and morality are often seen by society as “female values.” 
											
											A study conducted in 2007 found that there are two contrasting categories of clothing associated with positive and negative feminine morality. This study highlights factors linked with the choice of clothing and type of physical appearance found among young women. The judgements about a woman's character were found to be based on the immediate and apparent physical characteristics.
											
											According to Professor Widdows, the modern beauty standards are a global convergence of desirable features. The degree with which a woman follows these beauty ideals usually tend to influence her social status within her culture and society. These beauty standards often make perceptions and judgements about the character of a female as ‘good’ or ‘bad’, based on her visible personality characteristics.
											
											These beauty and morality standards can be highly dangerous. Women, whether at home or in their workspace, are expected to live up to the parameters of beauty everyday. This is not only irrational but greatly harmful. One of the main reasons that makes beauty standards detrimental is that we end up thinking of the “beautiful” people as morally superior when compared to supposedly “ugly” people. This puts down the self esteem of many women. 
											
											To sum up, I believe that the fact that beauty and morality are “female values” is woven into the fabric of society and that it must be unstitched as soon as possible.
											<br><br>
											Written by Ishita 
											
											“Femininity is a set of attributes, behaviors, and roles generally associated with women and girls”. This is the definition of femininity given on Wikipedia. Now, let's break it down: it says that this is a word used collectively for attributes and behaviours. Then it says that this collection of attributes and behaviours are associated with women or girls. Some of these attributes are morality and beauty, not beauty in a general sense; it is beauty according to society.  
											
											The less body hair you have, the thinner you are, the more beautiful you are according to society’s standards.  If you are a woman then you have to have a certain body type or skin color and you should be obedient. 
											
											 When a man breaks some sort of rule or fights for something or even goes out of line it's considered “macho” or “manly”, Whereas if you are a woman you have to follow the moral code: a woman never goes out of line. All of this has been happening for way too long now. So, shouldn’t we continue it? 
											
											No.
											
											Why is that we assign attributes and behaviours to being feminine or masculine? Why is it that only a certain gender can do or like certain things?  Why do we assign genders to things that do not need a gender?  I strongly believe that gender roles are utter nonsense, when you tell a human being they cannot be and do what they want just because they have certain genitals, it crushes individuality. Instead of focusing on the individual’s gender we should be focusing on the individual. 
											
											We are in the 21st century and it’s high time we let go of gender roles and let people be people.

										<h2 class="major">A Teenager’s Interests - Minds Unheard Voices To Be Spoken</h2>
										<p>A Teenager’s Interests are a group of young teenagers, who bring about a change in society for young minds. They attempt to bring goodness amongst the bad times the new generation has to offer. Started by Kaushal Talluri and supported by his fellow teammates (classmates/friends). We all are students of Future Kids.  <span id="dots3">...</span><span id="more3"> Each time for our event we brainstorm for teen development ideas. We come up with ideas and we go about the topics and find different topics which interests and inspire teens under the main topic. The webinars are conducted on an online platform using zoom. We have  a new chief guest each time informing and discussing their perspective and their suggestive concept of standing confident and strong.

											We have conducted four (4) successful events so far, 
											1. Fight your Frights 
											Our first webinar, we focused on stage fright in particular as teenagers need to be comfortable with the crowd they appeal to.
											We had an activity with the participants where our team had divided ourselves into groups and interacted with a group of 5 - 8 in a breakout room. It was an interactive way where everyone shared their experiences on stage fright. This activity helped them boost up their confidence and be open about their expressions. The agenda was to encourage teenagers to raise a strong voice in the society and a small activity was the first step towards being open and sharing and accepting perspective. 
											
											
											2. Dare to be Different 
											Our second webinar It was all about teens and how they should express themselves with a carefree spirit, how they should be comfortable having the spotlight. It is amazing to fit in but it is extraordinary to stand out. It is all about acceptance and standing up for yourself. 
											
											3. Talent show 
											Our first event to host an annual talent show. We had a talent show where teen participants could publicly perform and show their skills. It was to rejoice and stand proud for their talent. 
											The reason the talent show was hosted was for our viewers to apply what they have learned from our previous webinars and to highlight the understandings of ‘Fight your Frights’ and ‘Dare to be different’. 
											
											4. Empower the Possibilities.
											This was our recent webinar focussing on how we all have to grasp the opportunities offered to us and how we should always make the best out of what we have.
											Life is full of possibilities. But often, our struggles makes it hard for us to see the prize ahead.
											Due to some circumstances we usually can’t control, we give up too easily. We need to understand the situation and fight the situation. 
											Life needs to be empowered. We always need to keep this in mind that we need to find an alternative for every route we take and control our possibilities. 
											
											
											
											In conclusion we all would like to have young minds of the near future to  be accepting, talented and individuality. We believe that a young teenager needs the right path to walk on, and the right vision to work on. 
											We strive for progress and mold ourselves into something special and someone deserving.
