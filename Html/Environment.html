									<p >When we think of corals, we think of the Great Barrier Reef. 
										Australia has implemented certain reforms that protect the 
										reef such as the “reef 2050 long-term sustainability plan” 
										being implemented from 2015 to 2050, as the Australian government’s
										response to UNESCO’s World Heritage Committee’s recommendation to 
										protect the corals.
										Along with this, the Australian government has implemented new ship
										routes which avoid the area where the coral reefs are sensitive to
										protect them. This has been agreed by the IMO Sub-Committee on 
										Navigation<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">, Communications and Search and Rescue (NCSR), meeting 
										for its 2nd session. (9-13 March).						
										Coral are complex organisms that live in a symbiotic relationship 
										with algae, providing them with a home in their skeleton. During 
										the day, the algae produce food for the plant by photosynthesis but
										at night the coral polyps the organisms that makeup coral come out 
										and feed on small organisms. If untouched and unaffected by human
										actions, corals are “immortal” until a parrotfish feeds on it or
										it “fights” another coral.
										This is what happens when everything is normal, but when the 
										temperature rises or decreases just a few degrees things start 
										going wrong. It might only be by a few degrees but similar to
										the human body, when the temperature rises a few degrees things 
										go wrong. The algae in the coral stop producing food, so the coral
										ejects the algae and loses its main source of food and along with 
										it, it is colour and this is called “coral bleaching”. When this 
										happens, we can see through the transparent tissues and see the
										coral skeleton. At this stage, it might look beautiful but now 
										the coral is completely dependent on the polyps for their food
										. After a while, the coral dies out of starvation and turns 
										“fuzzy” as its tissues disintegrate. This is how the corals 
										that lived for hundreds of years die.
										In 2005, the U.S. lost half of its coral reefs in the Caribbean
										in one year due to a massive bleaching event
										The Great Barrier Reef has experienced five mass bleaching
										events – 1998, 2002, 2016, 2017 and 2020 – all caused b
										y rising ocean temperatures driven by global heating
										The main reason for the bleaching is rising temperatures i
										n the ocean caused by global warming. The oceans act as a si
										nk and absorb the heat. In the last decade (which is a smal
										l-time for corals) reports popped up saying corals are 
										turning “Neon”. Researchers stated this was a type of 
										“sunscreen” the corals started producing to protect the 
										algae from the excessive light and survive 
										the stress and recover after the temperatures recede
										but prolonged stress kills them.
										Right now, the only way to protect corals is the same 
										as to prevent glaciers and ice caps from melting,
										which is to stop global warming.</span>

								We all use the word ‘environment’ a lot, but most people don't 
								know that the word environment is derived from the French word 
								“environ” meaning to circle or surround in which organisms or
								groups of organisms live. The natural environment encompasses 
								all living and nonliving things occurring naturally, meaning 
								in this case not artificial. This environment encompasses the 
								interaction of all living species, climate, weather and natural
								resources that affect human survival and economic activity.

											Environmental pollution is not a new problem, yet it remains the world’s greatest problem
											facing humanity and the leading environmental cause of death. Many climate activists, such
											as Greta Thunberg and Margaret Thatcher, took steps to stop this, but man’s activities
											prevailed in the forms of urbanization, industrialization, mining, and exploration leading 
											to environmental pollution. Both developed and developing nations share this burden together,
											though awareness and stricter laws in developed countries have contributed to a larger extent 
											in protecting their environment. Despite the global attention towards pollution, the impact
											is still being felt due to its severe long-term consequences.

											“I was walking in the streets of Beijing when this problem of mine came up, I again started 
											coughing with all my might, and this has been happening for 5 years, but this time I suddenly 
											felt breathless, I grasped my throat in search of air and within seconds my body felt lighter
											and after a few more seconds, I couldn't feel a thing.” Just like this, 4.2 million people 
											per year are killed by air pollution according to WHO (World Health Organization).
											Air pollution is caused by various compounds due to the usage of vehicles and the 
											harmful substances released by industries, but mostly CO2. Nearly 1 million people 
											die each year from water sanitation and hygiene-related diseases which could be reduced
											with access to safe water or sanitation. Every 2 minutes, a child dies from a water-related disease.

											Célia Xakriabá, from the Amazons, spoke about the loss of biodiversity she has witnessed, 
											as well as the loss of connection with the earth that city-dwellers often experience. She 
											spoke about birds singing songs of misery “because most of them, they are alone. They have 
											lost their partners… And we, the indigenous are becoming more alone, because they’re taking 
											people from us”. This problem is not only faced by us humans but it is also faced by animals
											due to deforestation and other man-made problems that lead these species to extinction. 
											The statistics around threatened species are looking grim. An analysis found that  28,338 
											different species are at risk of extinction, and just imagining that future generations 
											won't be able to see these creatures is frightening.

								<h4>
									<p> Methods by which we can help protect the environment are :- <p/>
								</h4>
								
								<ul>

									<li>Share a ride or engage in carpooling.</li>
									<li>Instead of using your cars, choose to walk or ride a bicycle whenever possible.</li>
									<li>With this eco-friendly practice, you will also be healthier and happier by staying fit.</li>
									<li>Reconnect with nature.</li>
									<li>Hang your laundry to dry to minimize the use of gas or electricity from your dryers.</li>
									<li>Enjoy fresh air from open windows to lessen the use of air conditioning systems.</li>
									<li>Use eco-friendly or biodegradable materials instead of plastic which are made up of highly toxic substances injurious to your health.</li>
									<li>Switch to other forms of energy that are renewable and don't pollute the Earth-like, solar energy and hydroelectricity.</li>
									<li>Plant trees around your house, it will help boost the oxygen levels in your area. Encourage your friends to also do it.</li>

								<p>On the bright side, COVID-19 was like a sign to humans to reduce all these ill activities and due to these many bright effects came around. In many parts of the world where animals don't come around, during the lockdown they came there, for example in Venice, Italy, dolphins started showing around and many more.
									If we work together we can still save the environment.
