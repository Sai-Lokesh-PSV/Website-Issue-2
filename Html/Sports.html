							<span class="image main"><img src="./../Pictures/duringcovid.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Due to COVID, all sports leagues were cancelled or postponed including the cricket leagues. Last year, the Indian Premier League (IPL) was supposed to start on 29th March, 2020 but as the situation of the pandemic worsened, it started on 19th September, 2020. The matches are played with utmost caution. The players are tested beforehand and are quarantined in bubble rooms, which are used for social distancing. To avoid exposure, fans were not allowed to come and spectate the match in the stadium. This year IPL is being played across six cities: Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata.
