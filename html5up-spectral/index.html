								<h2>Imagine to draw the perspective</h2>
								<p>Why should one paint?<br />
									Painting sharpens the mind through conceptual visualization and implementation, plus, boosts memory skills. People using creative outlets such as writing, painting and drawing have less chance of developing memory loss illnesses when they get older.  It is not compulsory to learn but helps you be creative. It helps one to visualize and communicate with one another.  Painting provides a relaxing, open environment where artists feel safe to explore their creativity and encourages a more optimistic approach to life.  
									It helps you express one's emotions and thoughts that are part of eternal human nature and has a universal appeal. 
									Acrylics are more popular nowadays as it is easier to use, more cost-effective, and versatile.
									So in this article, we will be focusing on acrylics.<br><br>
									HISTORY<br />
									Otto Röhm invented acrylic resin- [An Acrylic resin is a thermoplastic substance typically derived from acrylic acid] which was quickly 
									transformed into acrylic paint. Synthetic paint was first used in the 1940s, combining some of the properties of oil and watercolour. mineral 
									spirit-based paints were introduced between 1946 and 1949 (professional paints that dry quickly). Acrylics were made commercially available in 
									the 1950s.<br><br>
									What is Acrylic Paint?<br />
									Water-based acrylic paint is composed of pigment particles dispersed in an acrylic polymer emulsion. There are three main components in any 
									acrylic paint - pigment, binder and vehicle:<br>
									1)Pigment - pigments are granular solids that give the paint its colour. They are milled to tiny particle size and do not dissolve, but remain 
									suspended in the paint.<br><br>

									2)Binder - a binder is the substance that keeps pigment in place after the paint dries. Acrylic paint has acrylic polymer as its binder.<br><br>

									3)Vehicle - this refers to the part of the paint that carries the pigment and binder. Water is the vehicle for water-based acrylic paints. 
									Once the water leaves the system via evaporation, the paint dries, creating a stable polymer film full of trapped coloured pigment particles.<br><br>

									Acrylic colours dry as a result of water evaporation. Here’s what occurs as pigment, water and acrylic are transformed into a long-lasting paint 
									film.

									Acrylic paint is a finely balanced dispersion of pigment in acrylic polymer and water. The water serves as the emulsion liquid and acts as a 
									kind of chemical ‘chaperone’.

									When exposed to the atmosphere, water in the emulsion evaporates or is absorbed into the painting support. That’s when the acrylic polymer 
									particles come into direct contact and fuse with each other.

									The clear polymer particles organize themselves into a stable, hexagonal structure, trapping the pigment in place and creating the paint film 
									which is extremely stable, water-resistant, permanent and vibrant.<br>

								<h2>Why Are acrylics preferred over oil paints?</h2>
								<p>Acrylics have water as the vehicle whereas oils use either turpentine or linseed oil as the vehicle. Oils give a glossy finish and last very long, 
									which makes it preferable to professional artists. On the other hand, acrylics give a basic finish and are peeled off quickly due to their thin 
									coat and are not very durable. Acrylics dry very quickly so are harder to work with whereas oils are time-taking but have a good finish. Although 
									oils are very expensive to use and need constant replenishing and acrylics are way cheaper.<br><br>
									<h2>Amazing inspiration for you all - Priyanka (Introduction)<br /> 
										(About her) 
										</h2>
										Priyanka is a certified artist specialized in drawing and painting and trained under the late Mr Aliuddin, protege of renowned artist the late 
										M.F. Hussain. True to her specialization, she works with oils on canvas and palette knife paintings as well, one of the focal points being 
										contemporary art. Her paintings, enlivened by colours, convey her passion and talent.

										Hi, I am Priyanka Ramana, director at Priyanka's school of art. I have taught art for more than 15 yrs, during which I have seen it evolve, change, 
										twist in different forms. But art is something which is always available and can be pursued and practiced at any place. Different mediums, different 
										styles, there is no rule, art works can be created with anything available. Water colors, charcoal, pencils, acrylic , oil… a  few need specific 
										supplies, but something like sketching can be done anytime anywhere just with a paper and a pencil. Canvas mediums like acrylics are loved by most of 
										the painters, as it dries faster, material handling is easier and the results are quick. The paints are quite bright, and both Matt and gloss results 
										can be achieved by using the gels. Acrylics can be used on different surfaces and  not just canvas, but also on  ceramic, wood, glass, tile etc.  It's 
										like a "go to " medium even for beginners. 
										Since the lockdown started , and people are in so much stress considering the situations, art has proven to be a stress reliever and a good 
										activity to keep yourself in a positive mind. Different forms like mandala, pencil sketching , acrylic have been practiced during this time to 
										feel good. Afterall art acts as a therapy in a lot of ways
